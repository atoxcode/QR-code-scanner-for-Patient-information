# QR Code Scanner for Patient

This android app base on java and have the goal to showing information patient. 

We are using localhost as the database of patient information, here is the link: https://github.com/atoxcode/patient-data-docker-version.

To making a connection from localhost into our app, we need to generate an API, and here is the tutorial: https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/android-from-scratch-using-rest-apis--cms-27117.

We are using NGROK as an API, here is the link: https://ngrok.com/

For QR Code scanner we are using the library from blikoon: https://github.com/blikoon/QRCodeScanner.

Thanks.
